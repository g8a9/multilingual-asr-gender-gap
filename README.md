# multilingual-asr-gender-gap
Code associated with the paper "Multilingual Speech Models for Automatic Speech Recognition Exhibit Gender Performance Gaps."

## Getting Started

1. Create a new python environment (python >= 3.9 is recommended)
2. Install the minimum requirements from `requirements.txt`

## Experiments

We release several bash and python scripts to replicate our experiments. Head to `/bash` or `/src` to find most relevant details. 

Script names and parameters are mostly self-explanatory, but do not esistate to open an issue to ask for more details (this is the preferred way over email).
